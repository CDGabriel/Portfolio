                        native
                        to
                        the Amazon river basin in Brazil. Due to their distinctive shape, calm behavior, many bright

                        and
                        patterns, and dedicated parenting techniques, discus are popular as freshwater aquarium fish,
                        and
                        their
                        aquaculture in several countries in Asia (notably Thailand) is a major industry.They are
                        sometimes
                        referred to as pompadour fish.The discus fish has attracted a cult following of collectors and
                        has
                        created a multimillion dollar international industry complete with shows, competitions, and

                        the
                        greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around
                        88%
                        of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty
                        frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal,

                    <div class="des">Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies, are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous
                        members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria.
                        Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the seabed by
                        stalks rather than being motile. They are made of an umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea,
                        known as the bell, and a collection of trailing tentacles on the underside. Via pulsating
                        contractions, the bell can provide propulsion for locomotion through open water. The tentacles
                        are
                        armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey or to defend against predators.</div>
